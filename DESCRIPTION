Description: This package allows the computation of clustering coefficients for directed and weighted networks 
    by using different approaches. It allows to compute clustering coefficients that are not present in igraph package. 
    A description of clustering coefficients can be found in Directed clustering in weighted networks: a new perspective, Clemente, G.P., Grassi, R. (2017),
