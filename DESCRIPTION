Description: Allows the computation of clustering coefficients for directed and weighted networks by using different approaches. 
    It allows to compute clustering coefficients that are not present in 'igraph' package. 
    A description of clustering coefficients can be found in "Directed clustering in weighted networks: a new perspective", Clemente, G.P., Grassi, R. (2017),
