#' Clustering Coefficient for Directed/Undirected and Weighted Networks
#'
#' Compute Local and Global (average) Clustering Coefficients
#' for Directed/Undirected and Unweighted/Weighted Networks.
#'
#' Formulas are based on Barrat et al. (2004) for undirected networks,
#' and on Clemente and Grassi (2018) for directed networks.
#'
#' In the directed case, different components of the directed clustering coefficient are also provided.
#'
#' @param mat A weighted adjacency matrix.
#' @param type The type of clustering coefficient to calculate.
#' Possible values are: \code{"undirected"} (default) or \code{"directed"}.
#' @param isolates Character scalar, defines how to treat vertices with degree zero and one.
#' If \code{"NaN"}, their local transitivity is reported as NaN and they are not included in the averaging. If \code{"zero"}, their transitivity is reported as 0 and they are included in the averaging. Default is \code{"zero"}.
#'
#' @details The function computes the Barrat et al. (2004) coefficient for a weighted and undirected network.
#' For a directed network, the Clemente and Grassi (2018) formula is used.
#' In case of unweighted and undirected graphs, the classical local clustering coefficient (Watts and Strogatz) is provided.
#' Local clustering coefficients are computed for each node,
#' and the global coefficient is the average of these local coefficients.
#' These coefficients do not work for graphs with multiple or loop edges, hence loops are removed.
