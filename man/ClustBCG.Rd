\title{Clustering Coefficient for Directed/Undirected and Weighted Networks}
\usage{
ClustBCG(mat, type = "undirected", isolates = "zero")
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{A weighted adjacency matrix.}

\item{type}{The type of clustering coefficient to calculate.
Possible values are: \code{"undirected"} (default) or \code{"directed"}.}

\item{isolates}{Character scalar, defines how to treat vertices with degree zero and one.
If \code{"NaN"}, their local transitivity is reported as NaN and they are not included in the averaging. If \code{"zero"}, their transitivity is reported as 0 and they are included in the averaging. Default is \code{"zero"}.}

\description{
Compute Local and Global (average) Clustering Coefficients
for Directed/Undirected and Unweighted/Weighted Networks.
}
\details{
Formulas are based on Barrat et al. (2004) for undirected networks,
and on Clemente and Grassi (2018) for directed networks.

In the directed case, different components of the directed clustering coefficient are also provided.

The function computes the Barrat et al. (2004) coefficient for a weighted and undirected network.
For a directed network, the Clemente and Grassi (2018) formula is used.
In case of unweighted and undirected graphs, the classical local clustering coefficient (Watts and Strogatz) is provided.
Local clustering coefficients are computed for each node,
and the global coefficient is the average of these local coefficients.
These coefficients do not work for graphs with multiple or loop edges, hence loops are removed.
